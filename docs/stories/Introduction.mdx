# React-Use-Wisely Hooks Library

React-Use-Wisely is a comprehensive collection of custom React hooks for common development tasks.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-use-wisely
# or
yarn add react-use-wisely
```

## Available Hooks

This library includes various categories of hooks to help you build React applications:

### Data Management & State

- **useAsync** - Handle asynchronous operations with loading, error, and success states. Includes built-in retry functionality.
- **useFetch** - A specialized hook for data fetching with automatic request cancellation and built-in caching.
- **useMap** - Stateful Map data structure with convenient methods for managing key-value pairs.
- **useSet** - Stateful Set data structure with convenient methods for managing unique values.
- **useLocalStorage** - Persist state to localStorage with the same API as useState.
- **useSessionStorage** - Like useLocalStorage but using sessionStorage for session-based persistence.
- **useReducerWithMiddleware** - Enhanced useReducer with middleware support for logging, analytics, etc.
- **usePrevious** - Keep track of the previous value of a variable for comparison or animation purposes.

### UI & Events

- **useClickOutside** - Detect clicks outside of a component (for modals, dropdowns, etc).
- **useHover** - Track whether an element is being hovered.
- **useKeyPress** - Detect when specific keys are pressed.
